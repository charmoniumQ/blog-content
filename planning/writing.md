To my friends, especially Matthew K.

I think you all should be writing more argumentative essays on the web.

Writing essays forces you to precisely state an opinion and think carefully about its defense. Often, I think of ideas which seem cogent until I put it down on paper. When it was in my head, it was entangled by unstated assumptions and half-baked concepts. Even essays reference a universe of ideas that the author expects the audience shares (Wittgenstein's beetle), but less so, and it gives my peers an opportunity to point this out. Not only does this improve the argument, but my position often changes as my argument evolves.

Writing like this really It helps develop professionally-useful reasoning skills. (shrug)

I appreciate the nuance in important debates; it is hard to find any opinion which seems universally devendable. However, overcaution makes it impossible to state any significant or useful claims. Writing essays forces one to balance the nuance with being decisive.

Originality is overrated in public writing. I don't need for my writing to serve others--it is primarily for me--but even if you do, perhaps your essay can say an old idea in a more elegant way. The great thing about being not famous is that there is no external pressure or expectation to deliver something worth reading; just something worth _writing_.

Writing essays can also be a fulfilling creative pursuit. I tend to pour hours just revising these essays, searching for explanatory gaps, and eliminating them satisfies something deep in me. Perhaps this is unique to me (I admit to being called "argumentative"), but you would have to try it yourself to know for sure ;)
