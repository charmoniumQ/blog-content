Walking around downtown aimlessly
Drivint without a destination
Puzzles like Rubik's cube
Learning by playing
Walking without talking to a good friend
Dating without expecting anything
Waiting patiently, entertained only by your own meandering thoughts

Not playing by ear
Not reading
Not conversations
