ILLIXR Switchboard

ILLIXR Spindle
	Compare to gobject

ILLIXR cpu_timer3
	cons of gprof:
		- measures everything, could have overhead
		- no information on dynamic arguments
		- captures caller of thread-launch
	caveats:
		- no recursion
		- **not for optimization**; for component comparison in a system
			- Not answering "how to make faster system with same components at a low-level?"; answering "which components take the most CPU time?"; answering "what's the end-to-end latency in my system?"
	Improvements:
		- Switchboard communicates its serial number
		- Also have integer-comments
		- Bloat-free (standardized?) binary file format
	Compare overhead per funccall

	21st century = years whose digits start with 20
	numbers between a and b should be b - a: so counting has to be inclusive-exclusive. so between 0 and 1 should be 1 number.
