### An old family story

My father told me stories of himself and his brothers messing around their
[Apple \]\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II). The Apple \]\[ had a
single-bit input line, for interfacing with external logic. After some
tinkering, the gang of brothers had devised a way to hook up a microphone so
that the Apple \]\[ could sample the 1-bit signal, and store it into memory, and
output the 1-bit signal through the internal speaker&mdash;voice recording
before it was cool. The intrepid four were ready to test the whole setup for the
first time and they decided their mother should speak the historic first words
to be recorded on the family Apple \]\[. She choose to preserve the following
words for posterity:

> "I think you guys are a bunch of nuts."

The Apple \]\[ was much cheaper than other personal computers (even though it was
over a thousand dollars), so it became the ideal computer for hobbyists like my
father. It enabled a generation of kids with too much free-time who taught
themselves how to use computer systems at fairly advanced levels. One of the
brothers said that being able to hack the Apple \]\[, among other things, led to a
fruitful career as an electrical engineer.

### Hobbyists today play with servers

Owning a server involves a lot of infrastructure which entails a high capital
expense. However once the infrastructure is in place, adding a virtual private
server for a blog like this one is relatively cheap due to _economy of
scale_. Therefore, it is highly efficient for a few companies like Amazon or
Digital Ocean to build a server farm and then have everyone else rent a little
piece of that server farm.

Cheap hosting is making server hardware accessible to hobbyists. This
inexpensive pricing gives hobbyists the opportunity to experiment and tinker on
the web. This blog itself is hosted on AWS. That ability to try new things
inexpensively is what will create a generation of good engineers.

### Engineers  are born young

Almost every engineer I know was started an early age (8-14) because s/he had an
insatiable interest in some topic. If you are very interested in airplanes, you
can read all about building and flying an airplane, but you can't actually build
or fly an airplane. That is where computers are different. Here we have the
chance to let kids dirty their hands with servers at an incredibly inexpensive
cost. You can get a nano-sized server from AWS Elastic Compute Cloud for 3.29$
per month, and you can get a high-powered 32-core computationally optimized
server for 1.68$ per hour (at the time in which this article was written,
[current prices](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)).

If you are a student, what more are you waiting for? Go out there and get the
[GitHub Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Spin up
some EC2 instances. The internet is chock-full of opportunity. Now is _your_
time to shine.
