_I gave a [TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/IQqb8HfN5hw) on this topic earlier. I have written and revised the same ideas in essay form._

### Math is art

In art, the practicioner gets to make up the rules, as long as you are consistent. For example Beethoven did not follow the rules of Classical music; Instead he and his contemporaries started his own movement of Romanticism with its own rules, norms, and feel. Likewise, Ren√© Descartes and his contemporaries saw that equations such as $x^2+1=0$ could not be solved with the existing number rules, so they created their own rules for numbers called complex numbers where $i^2=-1$.

It would be wrong to say that $x^2+1=0$ has solutions in the older set of rules, called 'real numbers', just as it would be wrong to analyze a Schubert piece as a purely classical work. What are real numbers besides a theoretical concept in someones head associated with a set of rules? If that is the case, why can we not invent our own theoretical concept with a new set of rules?

While I could invent a system in which every equation has the same solution, the resulting system is not that interesting. This is analagous to a composer who removes all of the rules and plays nothing. Just as it would be wrong to say that Baroque music is 'incorrect', no mathematical system by itself is 'incorrect', however certain systems have works which express some kind of elegance to them, and those are the ones we decide to study. Few would want to study a system where every equation has the same solution.
[comment]: <> (Certain works within a system have some kind of elegance to them, and some observers have a preference. For example, I generally prefer Romantic over Baroque)

While the system of real numbers can succintly encode the rules of electric charge, it turns out that complex numbers can better represent AC current.

From the Mayans to the Greeks, from Babylon to the Indus River, every civilization has developed their own unique style of music, painting, and math. It satisfies some universal desire of humankind to explore the unknown, express ideas, and awe at sheer beauty. Sometimes it happens to be useful, but its purpose is [to be beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology). The most famous result of Euclid, the number of primes is infinite, is a good example.

That's what math actually is to those who practice it; Most people have a less pleasant view of mathematics, because school ingrains a deap-seated hatred of anything that sounds like math. Not only does this rob the student of a beautiful experience, it fails to teach the 

### Color by number

Imagine you really like painting. But in every painting class for 12 years your assignments look like this.

Well, you get really good at coloring in the lines. But you never get to practice choosing your own colors or drawing your own lines. Surely no school would teach a creative subject in such a silly way, right?

Unfortunately, that is exactly what math class has become. Ask any student. They will say math class is stupid and boring. I agree.

### Types of problems

In order to sate the [demons of standardized testing](http://fairtest.org/how-standardized-testing-damages-education-pdf), the math is taught by 'types' of problems. Students memorize a template for the 'type' of problem and the procedure for solving it. 

[image]

This is what a typical worksheet looks like. Imagine twenty problems that are asking you to do the same thing, just with different numbers. Learning math has become a mindless memorization game.

Teachers can't predict every possible type of problem that students will encounter in the future. Math is supposed to be about solving problems that you don't already know the procedure to solve. This is where you learn to take pieces of things you do know to discover something you don't. That skill applies outside of math class.

### Checkerboard example

Here is a problem that requires original thinking to solve. You can't memorize this pattern of problems, because this problem is so original it doesn't fit into a category.

This is a checkerboard with dominoes where each domino takes up two squares.

[image]

It can be tiled with dominoes without any overlap or dominoes hanging off of the edge.

[image]

If I cut off the two opposite red corners, can I still tile the board?

[image]

You may identify one tiling pattern that does not work, but can you convince me that *no* tiling pattern will work?

* * *

This is a tough question, but in cases like this, a teacher can ask leading questions that guide the student to an answer for the difficult question. For example, I could ask,

1. How many squares are there on the original board?
<br /><button class="spoiler"></button>
<span><br />Since the board is 8x8, there were 64 squares before the two corner tiles were removed.</span>
2. After the corners are removed, how many of those that remain are black? How many are red?
<br /><button class="spoiler"></button>
<span><br />Out of the original 64, there must be 32 red and 32 black, but I cut off two red squares. Therefore there are 30 red and 32 black.</span>
3. Can I place a domino such that it covers only two black squares? or only one black square?
<br /><button class="spoiler"></button>
<span><br />No. Each domino must cover one red and one black, no matter how it is placed.</span>
4. Back to the original question, can all of the red tiles and all of the black tiles be covered by doominoes?
<br /><button class="spoiler"></button>
<span><br />No, because the are 32 black tiles, 30 red tiles, and each domino covers one of both. No matter how you do it, you will end up with two uncovered black tiles. [image]</span>

Most students are not trained to think in this way. Given a problem they don't know how to solve, even if guided to the solution, they won't 'make the jump'. But the world is filled with problems for which you cannot simply memorize the solution.

### Communication

The method of teaching by asking questions is how [Socrates explained mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno#Dialogue_with_Meno.27s_slave) to an undeducated slave. Explaining is an art (sadly, a lost one). There is no one right way to explain something, but some are better than others. The art is used in business, science, sales, and just about every other domain.

### 0.999... example

Let x = 0.

<table class="proof-table">
<tr><td>42x = 0 and 0 = 0x</td></tr>
<tr><td>42x = 0x</td></tr>
<tr><td>42x / x = 0x / x</td></tr>
<tr><td>42 = 0</td></tr>
</table>

The explanation was short, but convincing. He won us over to his side in about a minute.

Yet teacheers generally don't grade the explanation of an answer if the answer is correct. A mathemetician can prove the most groundbreaking theorem ever, but if he can't communitcate his findings, it doesn't matter if it is correct. Bloom's taxonomy of knowledge.

### Logic

Most students are given formulae but don't know why they are true. They believe it because their teacher tells them the right steps. It is purely argument from authority! Exactly what students of rhetoric learn to dismiss as logical fallacy!

Math is supposed to teach students about logical reasoning. But what stands to be reasoned in this example? Teaching types does not give the opportunity for using logic. The need for logical reasoning doesn't go away outside of the classroom. It prepare students to write essays in history class with original ideas that don't appeal to other authorities.

Just as the point of science is to use verifiable experiments to get to truth, the point of math is to use logical reasoning to get to truth. Most science classes have experiments, but most math classes don't have any arguments.

### 42 = 0 example

Another favorite debate in middle school. What's the flaw? Thinking about which step does not logically follow from the previous is exactly the same in a political debate. Consider the arugment:

(shows example)

But finding the flaw in a mathematical argument is the same type of thinking as finding a flaw in a political argument.

(shows example)

This skill is used all over the place

Imagine how much better our political discourse would be if everyone practiced logical reasoning in school. Now, we need tha more than ever.

### Making things better

Twelve years of these two things combined extinguish any remaining remnant of creativity, curiosity, and inspiration from students. It's no wonder most students hate math.

You don't need a fancy math class to think critically and argue. Anybody can do that, and everybody should do that. As books take the burdern of memorization away from us, and calculators take the burden of computation away from us, the only thing left on our plate is critical thinking.
