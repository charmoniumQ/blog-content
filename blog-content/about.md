My name is Samuel Grayson and I am a student. I say that partly in the
official sense (I do attend a university) and partly in the sense that
I crave learning. And the part that I find the most intriguing is
conversation between well-informed but differing perspectives. I hope
be able to supply one of those perspectives, that is why I keep up a
blog. Comments coming soon (that's where the other perspectives come
from).
