My name is Samuel Grayson and I am a student. I say that partly in the official
sense (I attend a university) and partly in the sense that I crave learning. And
the part that I find the most intriguing is conversation between well-informed
but differing perspectives. I hope be able to supply one of those perspectives,
that is why I keep up a blog.
