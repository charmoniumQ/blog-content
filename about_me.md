My name is Samuel Grayson, and I am a student. I say that partly in the formal
sense (I attend a university) and partly in the sense that I crave learning. And
the part that I find the most intriguing is conversation between well-informed
but differing perspectives. I hope to be able to supply one of those
perspectives; that is why I keep up a blog.
